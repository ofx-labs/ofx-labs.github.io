## What is SeekDB?

SeekDB is a revolutionary vector database that brings powerful search capabilities directly to your browser and local applications. Unlike traditional databases that require server infrastructure, SeekDB runs entirely on the client side.

## Key Features

### 1. Embeddable Architecture

SeekDB can be embedded directly into your application, eliminating the need for external database servers. This makes it perfect for:

- Browser-based applications
- Electron apps
- Local-first applications
- Edge computing scenarios

### 2. Vector Search

Built-in support for vector similarity search enables powerful AI features:

- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- Content matching
- Similarity detection

### 3. Lightweight Design

With a minimal footprint, SeekDB doesn't bloat your application:

- Small bundle size
- Fast initialization
- Low memory usage
- Efficient indexing

## Use Cases

SeekDB is ideal for:

- **Local AI applications**: Run AI models with local vector storage
- **Knowledge bases**: Build personal or team knowledge management systems
- **Search engines**: Create powerful search without server infrastructure
- **Recommendation systems**: Build recommendation engines that run client-side

## Getting Started

Getting started with SeekDB is straightforward:

```typescript
import { SeekDB } from 'seekdb-client';

const db = new SeekDB();
await db.initialize();

// Add vectors
await db.add({
  id: 'doc1',
  vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
  metadata: { title: 'My Document' }
});

// Search
const results = await db.search([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], { limit: 10 });
```

## The Future

SeekDB represents a new era of database technology—one where powerful features are available locally, without compromising on performance or capabilities.

As web applications become more sophisticated and AI becomes more prevalent, tools like SeekDB will be essential for building the next generation of applications.
