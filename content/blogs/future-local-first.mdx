## Introduction

The web has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. From static HTML pages to dynamic server-rendered applications, and now to client-side frameworks that push the boundaries of what's possible in a browser.

But there's a new paradigm emerging: **local-first development**. This approach prioritizes running applications entirely on the user's device, with optional synchronization when needed.

## What is Local-First?

Local-first applications are designed to work **offline-first**, storing data locally and synchronizing when connectivity is available. This approach offers several key advantages:

- **Instant responsiveness**: No network latency
- **Privacy**: Data stays on the device
- **Reliability**: Works even when offline
- **Performance**: No server round-trips for basic operations

## The Role of SeekDB

SeekDB is a lightweight, embeddable vector database designed specifically for local-first applications. It enables:

- **Vector search** directly in the browser
- **Local storage** without external dependencies
- **AI-powered features** that run entirely client-side

## Conclusion

The future of web development is local-first. As browsers become more powerful and databases like SeekDB make local storage more capable, we'll see a shift toward applications that prioritize user privacy, performance, and reliability.

The next wave of web applications won't just be faster—they'll be fundamentally different in how they handle data and where computation happens.
