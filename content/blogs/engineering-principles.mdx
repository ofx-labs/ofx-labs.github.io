## Our Philosophy

At OFX Labs, we believe that great software comes from great principles. Our engineering approach is guided by a few core beliefs that shape everything we build.

## Principle 1: Experimentation First

We're not afraid to try new things. The technology landscape changes rapidly, and the best way to stay ahead is to experiment:

- **Try new frameworks**: Don't stick with what's comfortable
- **Build prototypes**: Rapid iteration leads to better solutions
- **Learn from failures**: Every experiment teaches us something

## Principle 2: Local-First Architecture

We prioritize building applications that work locally:

- **Offline capability**: Applications should work without internet
- **Privacy by design**: User data stays on their device
- **Performance**: Local operations are faster than network calls

## Principle 3: Open Source When Possible

While not everything can be open source, we believe in:

- **Sharing knowledge**: Open source helps everyone learn
- **Community contribution**: Great ideas come from collaboration
- **Transparency**: Open code builds trust

## Principle 4: Developer Experience Matters

We invest heavily in developer experience:

- **Clear documentation**: Every project needs good docs
- **Type safety**: TypeScript everywhere
- **Tooling**: Great tools make great products

## Principle 5: Simplicity Over Complexity

Complexity is the enemy of maintainability:

- **Simple solutions**: Prefer simple over clever
- **Clear code**: Code should be readable by anyone
- **Minimal dependencies**: Fewer dependencies mean fewer problems

## Conclusion

These principles guide our work every day. They're not rules carved in stone, but living guidelines that evolve as we learn and grow.

Building software is a journey, and these principles help us navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology.
